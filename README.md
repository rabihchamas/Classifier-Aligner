# Classifier-Aligner
This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning architecture that consists of a classifier and an Aligner. The classifier maps data to classes, and the Aligner tries to match the data to the classifier output.
The Classifier Aligner Network is a deep learning architecture that embodies a game with classifier and aligner agents. The classifier maps a sequence of images to class representations, known as class vectors. Meanwhile, the sequence will be shuffled and passed to the Aligner together with corresponding class vectors, where the Aligner's objective is to reorder the images in the original order using the class vectors. The architecture operates on the principle that the Aligner can only match the data to the corresponding class vectors if the classifiers' outputs correlate meaningfully with the input. In essence, we design a Classifier Aligner Network to achieve unsupervised learning through a collaborative effort between the classifier and the Aligner.
